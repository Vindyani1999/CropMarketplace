This project is an online platform that serves as a marketplace for local crop producers to connect with consumers and facilitate the delivery of fresh produce. It aims to support local farmers by providing them with a platform to sell their crops directly to consumers while also offering a convenient way for users to purchase fresh, locally sourced produce.
